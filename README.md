# Flutter Markdown Notes

This is a Proof of Concept for a Flutter app that supports taking and organizing notes. Each note has a title and body, and can be added and edited within the app. The app uses a `Note` class to represent a single note, and a `NoteProvider` class to manage a list of `Note` objects and provide methods for adding and updating notes.

## Current Features

- Create and edit notes
- View a list of all notes

## Roadmap 

The following features are planned for future development:

- Database integration: Store notes in a database for persistent storage and easier data management.
- Note organization: Allow the user to organize notes into folders or tags.
- Note search: Implement a search feature to allow the user to quickly find a specific note.
- Note history: Allow the user to view past versions of a note and restore to a previous version if needed.
- Rich text formatting: Allow markdown formatting for notes to improve handling of code related notes.

The app will get a design overhaul once the basic features have been fully mapped out.
